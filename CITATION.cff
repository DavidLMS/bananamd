abstract: >
  BananaMD is a client-side application that rapidly illustrates Markdown
  documents and slide decks using Gemini 2.5 Flash Image Preview (a.k.a.
  Nano Banana). The app detects image references in Markdown or in a zipped
  project, proposes two high‑quality candidates per reference, supports
  iterative text edits with version history, and exports an updated Markdown
  file together with all images using descriptive, accessible filenames and
  generated alt text. Existing images (local, data URLs, and downloadable
  HTTP URLs) are treated as starting points for style‑transfer/improve flows;
  otherwise images are generated from document‑aware text prompts.
